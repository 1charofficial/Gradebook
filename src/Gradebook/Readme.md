This project is a gradebook which is used to hold data for individual students grades.
It is a basic console application written in c# using .net core runtime and library.
I have also produced a test project file and completed some inital tests, however I have more to complete.
I have added a solution file so that I do not have to keep changing projects in the terminal when I run tests. I can now just test and build in the same place.
I also aim to re-factor some code and I will also add more functionality to the application.

Things to do:

More functionality.
Further testing.
Code re-factoring.
